__________________________________

Create user
Takes in a username, email, and password. The webpage handles password requirements such as length. If the username or email
has already been taken, the database will return an error that the server will need to handle, and tell the client
that the user needs to enter different information. Valid input is added to the 'user' and 'password' tables.

BEGIN;
INSERT INTO user (Username, Email, DateJoined) VALUES('nameEntry', 'emailEntry', NOW());
INSERT INTO passwords (UIDno, encrypted) VALUES(LAST_INSERT_ID(), 'passwordEntry');
COMMIT;
__________________________________

Verify login
User enters a username and password. The server looks in the database to see if the password is correct. It must look at
the User table to retrieve the user's ID, then get the password to present to the server so it can compare.\

SELECT encrypted FROM passwords as p, user as u WHERE u.Username LIKE 'userEntry' AND p.UIDno = u.UID;
