Create user
Takes in a username, email, and password. The webpage handles password requirements such as length. If the username or email
has already been taken, the database will return an error that the server will need to handle, and tell the client
that the user needs to enter different information. Valid input is added to the 'user' and 'password' tables.

BEGIN;
INSERT INTO user (Username, Email, DateJoined) VALUES('nameEntry', 'emailEntry', NOW());
INSERT INTO passwords (UIDno, encrypted) VALUES(LAST_INSERT_ID(), 'passwordEntry');
COMMIT;
